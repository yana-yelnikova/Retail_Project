# üìà Omnichannel Sales Data Unification (Shopify & Walmart)

This project demonstrates the process of building a centralized data pipeline using dbt (data build tool) to unify sales data from an online store (Shopify) and a chain of physical stores (selling through Walmart). The goal is to provide a comprehensive, integrated view of omnichannel sales for enhanced business analytics.

***

## üéØ Business Case

A mid-sized retailer aims to consolidate its online (Shopify) and in-store (Walmart) sales data into a centralized data warehouse. This unification enables:

* **Revenue Tracking:** Real-time comparison of online vs. in-store sales performance.
* **Best-Selling Products:** Identification of top products across all channels for optimized inventory and marketing.
* **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Understanding cross-channel shopping patterns to tailor marketing strategies.
* **Operational Efficiency:** Elimination of manual reporting and reduction of data reconciliation errors.

The project builds a fully automated data pipeline that ingests, processes, and visualizes omnichannel sales data, empowering data-driven decisions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Data Transformation:** [dbt (data build tool)](https://www.getdbt.com/)
* **Data Warehouse:** [Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/)
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## üìä Data Sources

This project utilizes two primary sales datasets:

1.  **Shopify Orders Data:** Represents e-commerce transactions.
    * **Original Columns:** `ORDER_ID`, `SKU`, `PRODUCT_NAME`, `CATEGORY`, `CHANNEL`, `CUSTOMER_EMAIL`, `PRICE`, `QUANTITY`, `ORDER_DATE`, `WEEK`, `YEAR`.
2.  **Walmart Sales Data:** Represents in-store transactions.
    * **Original Columns:** `TRANSACTION_ID`, `PRODUCT_ID`, `PRODUCT_NAME`, `CATEGORY`, `CUSTOMER_AGE`, `CUSTOMER_GENDER`, `CUSTOMER_ID`, `CUSTOMER_INCOME`, `CUSTOMER_LOYALTY_LEVEL`, `FORECASTED_DEMAND`, `HOLIDAY_INDICATOR`, `INVENTORY_LEVEL`, `PAYMENT_METHOD`, `PROMOTION_APPLIED`, `PROMOTION_TYPE`, `QUANTITY_SOLD`, `REORDER_POINT`, `REORDER_QUANTITY`, `STOCKOUT_INDICATOR`, `STORE_ID`, `STORE_LOCATION`, `SUPPLIER_ID`, `SUPPLIER_LEAD_TIME`, `TRANSACTION_DATE`, `UNIT_PRICE`, `WEATHER_CONDITIONS`, `WEEKDAY`, `ACTUAL_DEMAND`.

### üìÇ Raw Data Files (For Reference/Reproducibility)

The original raw data files, which were loaded into Snowflake, are located in the data/ folder within this repository.

## ‚ú® Data Transformation Steps (dbt Models)

1.  ### Staging Layer (`models/staging/`)
    * **Purpose:** Initial raw data cleaning and standardization.
    * `stg_walmart.sql`: Performs basic cleaning and standardizes column names (e.g., to `snake_case`) from the raw Walmart source.
    * `shopify_orders_with_full_categories.sql`: Selects all columns from raw Shopify orders and adds a `full_category_name` column by mapping `CATEGORY` abbreviations to full names.

2.  ### Intermediate Layer (`models/intermediate/`)
    * **Purpose:** Applying specific business logic, filtering data, and further standardization.
    * `shopify_matched_products.sql`: Filters data from `shopify_orders_with_full_categories` to include only the specified electronic products (`Laptop`, `Headphones`, `Smartphone`, `Tablet`) and calculates `total_item_revenue`.
    * `walmart_matched_products.sql`: Filters data from `stg_walmart` to include only the specified electronic products, calculates `total_item_revenue`, and **standardizes `full_category_name` to 'Electronics'** for these products.

3.  ### Analytics Layer (`models/marts/`)
    * **Purpose:** To provide a unified, business-friendly view of sales data, optimized for direct consumption by Business Intelligence (BI) tools and analytical queries.
    * `unified_sales.sql`: This is the core omnichannel sales data mart. Built using **Snowflake**'s powerful processing capabilities, it `UNION ALL`s the filtered data from `shopify_matched_products` and `walmart_matched_products`.
        * It ensures **consistent column names and data types** across both channels.
        * It handles missing data by inserting `NULL` values for channel-specific columns where data is absent (e.g., `store_id` for Shopify, `customer_age` for Walmart).
        * The `sales_channel` column (`Online`/`Offline`) is explicitly included for easy cross-channel comparison.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Ensure Raw Data in Snowflake:**
    * This dbt project expects your raw `SHOPIFY_ORDERS` and `WALMART` tables to be already loaded into your `RETAIL_PROJECT.PUBLIC` schema in Snowflake. (You can use the `.csv` or `.json` files in the `data/` folder as a reference for the data structure if needed for manual loading).
3.  **Configure dbt:**
    * Ensure you have dbt Core (`pip install dbt-snowflake`) or dbt Cloud set up.
    * Update your `~/.dbt/profiles.yml` (for dbt Core) or your dbt Cloud connection settings with your Snowflake credentials (Account, User, Password/Key, Role, Warehouse, Database, Schema). **Do NOT commit `profiles.yml` to Git if it contains sensitive credentials.**
4.  **Run dbt Models:**
    * Execute the full dbt build process to create all models and run tests:
        ```bash
        dbt build
        ```
    * Alternatively, run specific models (e.g., just the final mart):
        ```bash
        dbt run --select unified_sales
        ```
5.  **Generate Documentation (Optional but Recommended):**
    ```bash
    dbt docs generate
    dbt docs serve # For local viewing
    ```
    (In dbt Cloud, access documentation via the "Docs" tab.)

## üìà Analysis & Insights

Once `unified_sales` is built in Snowflake, you can connect your BI tool to `RETAIL_PROJECT.<YOUR_DBT_SCHEMA>.unified_sales` to generate insights, such as:

* **Omnichannel Revenue Performance:** Track total sales and revenue by `sales_channel`.
* **Top Products:** Identify best-selling `product_name` and `full_category_name` across all channels.
* **Channel-Specific Trends:** Analyze `quantity_sold` and `total_item_revenue` over `transaction_date` for `Online` vs. `Offline` sales.
* **Customer Demographics (Walmart):** Leverage `customer_age`, `customer_gender`, etc., for deeper segmentation within the offline channel.
